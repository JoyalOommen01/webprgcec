		<p>A flower can be defined as the reproductive unit of any angiosperms. Flowers carry out sexual reproduction in angiosperms. A typical flower is generally an attractively modified stem with a condensed axis.

A flower has four different parts, they are - calyx, corolla, androecium, and gynoecium. The parts androecium and gynoecium contain the male and female reproductive organs of a flower respectively. </p>
